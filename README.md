# genai_basics

Repository for foundational **Generative AI experiments** including:

- Prompt Engineering with open LLMs (e.g., Ollama, Groq)
- Basic LLM usage and exploration
- Simple Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) demos

This repo will house small experiments and learning code as I work through courses and build hands‑on GenAI projects.

## About

This repository is focused on **foundational Generative AI programming**, where I will:

- Explore prompt engineering techniques with open models
- Experiment with different LLMs in Python
- Build simple demos for RAG and related concepts

It serves as a **workspace for learning, experimenting, and documenting** core GenAI concepts.
